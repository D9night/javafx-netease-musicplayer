# JavaFX-Netease-Music-Player
This is a imitation of Netease Music Player which is a Universal Windows Platform program.Now it can play music through the folder you have chose,control music progress and volume.But something other cool animation,album image and lyric are not developed.

I am a Chinese student,so my English maybe not so good.

src folder is the Java source files. libraries folder is the using library folder.

I am grad to share my program,I would appreciate if someone can help me pop-up a pane like showing play list.I don't know how to show a pop-up pane to show a playing music list.
